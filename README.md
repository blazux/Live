# Hello fellow linux user !

Blazux Live CD is just a test, DON'T USE IT ! Seriously, just don't.

If you're still reading :
 - it's just a modified version of the Arch Linux install disk, if you want to install Arch Linux use the official disk not Blazux. 
 - it comes with a bunch of software related to security, if you want to perform some pentest, use Kali not Blazux.
 - it also comes with some media related softwares, if you want to listen to music with a live CD use anything you want not Blazux.
